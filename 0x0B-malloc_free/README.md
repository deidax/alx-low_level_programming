# 0x0B. C - malloc, free


## Automatic vs Dynamic Allocation

In C programming, memory can be allocated in two ways: automatic and dynamic allocation.

Automatic allocation, also known as stack allocation, occurs when variables are allocated memory automatically within a function. The memory is released automatically when the function scope ends.

Dynamic allocation, on the other hand, allows for allocating memory at runtime. It provides greater flexibility as memory can be allocated and deallocated dynamically during program execution.

## Understanding malloc and free

`malloc` and `free` are functions provided by the C standard library for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

- `malloc` stands for "memory allocation" and is used to request a block of memory from the heap. It takes the size of the memory block in bytes as an argument and returns a pointer to the allocated memory block.

  Example usage:
  ```c
  int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));
  ```

- `free` is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated using `malloc`. It takes a pointer to the memory block as an argument and frees the allocated memory, making it available for reuse.

  Example usage:
  ```c
  free(ptr);
  ```

## Benefits of Using malloc

The use of dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` offers several advantages:

- Dynamic allocation allows for flexible memory management, enabling the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks as needed during program execution.
- It enables the creation of data structures of varying sizes, such as arrays and linked lists, without the need for fixed-size declarations.
- Dynamic allocation helps optimize memory usage by allocating memory only when required and freeing it when no longer needed.
- It allows for sharing memory blocks across different parts of the program, enabling efficient data sharing and reducing memory duplication.

## Using Valgrind for Memory Leak Detection

Valgrind is a powerful tool for debugging and profiling programs. It includes a memory-checking tool called Memcheck, which can detect memory leaks and other memory-related errors.

To use Valgrind for memory leak detection:

1. Install Valgrind on your system.
2. Compile your C program with debugging symbols using the `-g` flag.
3. Run the program under Valgrind using the following command:
   ```
   valgrind --leak-check=full ./your_program
   ```
   Valgrind will execute your program and monitor memory allocations and deallocations.
4. Analyze the Valgrind output to identify any memory leaks or memory errors reported.

Valgrind provides detailed information about memory leaks, including the exact locations in the code where the leaked memory was allocated. This helps in identifying and fixing memory-related issues in your program.

It is recommended to use Valgrind during development and testing to ensure proper memory management and prevent memory leaks.
