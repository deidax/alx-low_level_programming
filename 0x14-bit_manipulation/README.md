# Bit Manipulation and Bitwise Operators

Bit manipulation is the process of modifying or extracting specific bits within binary data. It involves performing operations at the bit level, allowing for more efficient and compact coding techniques. Bitwise operators are used to manipulate individual bits or sets of bits within variables.

## Bitwise Operators

The following are commonly used bitwise operators in C:

- `&` (AND): Performs a bitwise AND operation between two operands, resulting in a new value with bits set where both operands have corresponding bits set.
- `|` (OR): Performs a bitwise OR operation between two operands, resulting in a new value with bits set where at least one of the operands has a corresponding bit set.
- `^` (XOR): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between two operands, resulting in a new value with bits set where only one of the operands has a corresponding bit set.
- `~` (NOT): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a single operand, flipping all the bits in the value.
- `<<` (Left Shift): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by a specified number of positions, filling the shifted positions with zeros.
- `>>` (Right Shift): Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by a specified number of positions, filling the shifted positions with the sign bit (for signed values) or with zeros (for unsigned values).

## Bit Manipulation Techniques

Bit manipulation can be used for various purposes, such as:

- Setting a bit: Use the OR operator (`|`) with a bitmask to set a specific bit to 1 while preserving the other bits.
- Clearing a bit: Use the AND operator (`&`) with the complement of a bitmask to set a specific bit to 0 while preserving the other bits.
- Toggling a bit: Use the XOR operator (`^`) with a bitmask to toggle a specific bit (i.e., flip its value) while preserving the other bits.
- Checking if a bit is set: Use the AND operator (`&`) with a bitmask to check if a specific bit is set (equals 1).
- Shifting bits: Use the left shift (`<<`) or right shift (`>>`) operators to shift the bits of a value to the left or right by a specified number of positions.

### Creating a 64 bits mask
The line `unsigned long int m = 1UL << (sizeof(unsigned long int) * 8 - 1);` in C is used to initialize an `unsigned long int` variable named `m` with a mask value. Let's break down this line and explain each part:

1. `sizeof(unsigned long int) * 8`: The `sizeof` operator returns the size of the `unsigned long int` data type in bytes. By multiplying it with 8, we get the number of bits in an `unsigned long int` value.

2. `(sizeof(unsigned long int) * 8 - 1)`: Subtracting 1 from the total number of bits gives us the index of the most significant bit (MSB) in an `unsigned long int` value. The MSB is the leftmost bit in the binary representation.

3. `1UL << (sizeof(unsigned long int) * 8 - 1)`: The `<<` operator is the left shift operator. It shifts the bits of the number `1UL` (which is equivalent to `1` as an `unsigned long int`) to the left by the number of positions specified by `(sizeof(unsigned long int) * 8 - 1)`. This effectively sets the bit at the MSB position to 1, while all other bits remain 0.

4. `unsigned long int m = 1UL << (sizeof(unsigned long int) * 8 - 1);`: The result of the left shift operation is assigned to the `m` variable, which is of type `unsigned long int`. This initializes `m` with a mask that has a 1 at the MSB position and 0s in all other bit positions.

To better understand the binary representation of the mask, let's consider an example where `unsigned long int` is assumed to be 8 bytes (64 bits):

```
sizeof(unsigned long int) = 8 bytes = 64 bits
sizeof(unsigned long int) * 8 = 64
sizeof(unsigned long int) * 8 - 1 = 63

1UL = 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 (64 bits)

1UL << 63 = 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (64 bits)

```

In this example, the mask `m` is initialized with the binary value `1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, which represents the most significant bit set to 1 and all other bits set to 0.
