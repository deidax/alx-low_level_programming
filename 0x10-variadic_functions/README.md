## Variadic Functions

- Variadic functions are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments.
- They provide flexibility by allowing functions to accept different numbers and types of arguments.
- Variadic functions are declared with an ellipsis (...) in the function parameter list.

## va_start, va_arg, and va_end Macros

- These macros are used to access the variable arguments in a variadic function.

### va_start
- The va_start macro initializes the va_list object that allows access to the variable arguments.
- It takes two parameters: the va_list object and the last named parameter before the ellipsis.

### va_arg
- The va_arg macro retrieves the next argument of the specified type from the va_list.
- It takes two parameters: the va_list object and the type of the argument to retrieve.
- va_arg also advances the position within the argument list.

### va_end
- The va_end macro performs the necessary cleanup after accessing the variable arguments.
- It takes one parameter: the va_list object to be closed.

## The const Type Qualifier

- The const qualifier is used to declare variables that should not be modified after initialization.
- It provides a way to enforce read-only access and immutability in C programs.
- Applying const to a variable allows the compiler to perform optimizations and catch potential errors.

### Benefits of const
- Prevents accidental modification of variables, improving code reliability and maintainability.
- Helps in identifying and preventing potential bugs by making intent explicit.
- Enables the compiler to optimize code by assuming the const variables remain unchanged.
